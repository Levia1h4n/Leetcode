### Big O
The O is short for “Order of”. If we’re discussing an algorithm with O(n), we say its **order of**, or **rate of growth**, is n, or linear complexity.

| O            | Complexity  |
| -            | -           |
| O(1)         | constant    |
| O(log n)     | logarithmic |
| O(n)         | linear      |
| O(n * log n) | log linear	 |
| O(n^2)       | quadratic   |
| O(n^3)       | cubic       |
| O(2^n)       | exponential |
| O(n!)        | factorial   |
